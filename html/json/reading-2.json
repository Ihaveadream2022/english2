{"title":"Michael Jordan remembers his 'little brother' Kobe Bryant. Read his entire speech.","content":"<div class=\"content\"><p>    <p>I would say good morning, but it's afternoon. I'm grateful to Vanessa and the Bryant family for the opportunity to speak today.</p><p>    <p>I'm grateful to be here to honor Gigi and celebrate the gifts that Kobe gave us all –&nbsp; what he accomplished as a basketball player, as a businessman, and a storyteller and as a father.&nbsp; In the game of basketball, in life, as a parent – Kobe left nothing in the <span style=\"background-color:#009688;color:#fafafa;\"><i><span class=\"blue bold\">tank</span></i></span>. He left it all on the floor.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p class=\"img-box\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2020/02/24/USAT/ffdf0e20-1915-41ba-aac2-6186f454cfe1-XXX_NBA__Celebration_of_life_for_Kobe_and_Gianna_Bryant_2020022.JPG?width=660&amp;height=538&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp\" alt=\"picture\"></p><p>    <p class=\"img-box\" style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>Maybe it surprised people that Kobe and I were very close friends. But we were very close friends.&nbsp; Kobe was my dear friend. He was like a little brother.&nbsp; Everyone always wanted to talk about the comparisons between he and I.&nbsp; I just wanted to talk about Kobe.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>You know all of us have brothers and sisters, little brothers, little sisters,&nbsp; who for whatever reason always tend to get in your <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">stuff</span></span>, your closet, your shoes, everything.&nbsp; It was a <span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fff8e1;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">nuisance</span> </span>– if I can say that word – but that <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fff8e1;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">nuisance</span> </span>turned into love <span class=\"blue bold\">over a period of time</span>.&nbsp; Just because the <span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">admiration</span></span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;\"> </span>that they have for you as big brothers or big sisters,&nbsp; the questions they're wanting to know every little detail about life that they were about to <span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fff8e1;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">embark on</span></span>.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>He used to call me, text me, 11:30, 2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning, talking about <span class=\"blue bold\">post-up moves</span>, <span class=\"blue bold\">footwork</span>, and sometimes, the triangle.&nbsp; At first, it was an <span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">aggravation</span></span>. But then it turned into a <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\">certain </span>passion. This kid had passion like you would never know.&nbsp; It's an amazing thing about passion. If you love something, if you have a strong passion for something,&nbsp; you would go to the extreme to try to understand or try to get it. <span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">Either</span></span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;\"> </span>ice cream, Cokes, hamburgers, whatever you have a love for.&nbsp; If you have to walk, you would go get it. If you have to beg someone, you would go get it.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>What Kobe Bryant was to me was the <span class=\"blue bold\">inspiration</span> that someone truly cared about the way<span style=\"color:#fafafa;\"> </span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">either</span></span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;\"> </span>I played the game or the way that he wanted to play the game.&nbsp; He wanted to be the best basketball player that he could be. And as I got to know him, I wanted to be the best big brother that I could be.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>To do that, you have to <span class=\"blue bold\">put up with</span> the aggravation, the late-night calls, or the <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">dumb</span></span> questions.&nbsp; I took great pride as I got to know Kobe Bryant that he was just trying to be a better person – a better basketball player.&nbsp; We talked about business, we talked about family, we talked about everything. And he was just trying to be a better person.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>Now, he's got me and I'll have to look at another <span class=\"bold\">crying meme</span> for the next ...&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>I told my wife I wasn't gonna do this cause I didn't want to see that for the next three or four years.&nbsp; That is what Kobe Bryant does to me. I'm pretty sure Vanessa and his friends all can say the same thing –&nbsp; <span class=\"blue bold\">he knows how to get to you</span> in a way that affects you personally, even though he's being <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">a pain in the ass</span></span>.&nbsp; But you have a sense of love for him and the way that he can <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">bring out</span></span> the best in you. And he did that for me.&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>I remember maybe <span class=\"blue bold\">a couple months ago</span> he sends me a text and he said, <span class=\"quot\">\"I'm trying to teach my daughter some moves.&nbsp; And I don't know what I was thinking or what I was working on, but what were you thinking about when you were growing up trying to</span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;\"><span class=\"quot\"> </span></span><span style=\"background-color:#9e9d24;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"quot blue bold\">work on</span></span><span class=\"quot\"> your moves?\"&nbsp;</span> I said <span class=\"quot\">\"What age?\"</span> He says <span class=\"quot\">\"12\".</span> I said <span class=\"quot\">\"12, I was trying to play baseball.\"</span> He sends me a text back saying <span class=\"quot\">\"</span><span class=\"quot blue bold\">Laughing my </span><span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"quot blue bold\">ass </span></span><span class=\"quot blue bold\">off</span><span class=\"quot\">.\"&nbsp;</span> And this is at 2 o'clock in the morning.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>But the thing about him was we could talk about anything that related to basketball but we could talk about anything that related to life.&nbsp; And we, as we grew up in life, <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">rarely</span> </span>have friends that we can have <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\">conversations </span>like that.&nbsp; Well, it's even rarer when you can grow up against <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">adversaries</span> </span>and have conversations like that.&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>I went and saw Phil Jackson in 1999, maybe 2000, I don't know, when Phil was here in L.A. And I walk in and Kobe's sitting there.</p><p>    <p>And the first thing, Kobe said, <span class=\"quot\">\"Did you bring your shoes?\"</span></p><p>    <p><span class=\"quot\">\"No, I wasn't thinking about playing.\"</span></p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>But his attitude to <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">compete</span> </span>and play against someone he felt like he could enhance and improve his game, that's what I loved about the kid.&nbsp; I absolutely loved the kid. No matter where he saw me, it was a challenge.&nbsp; And I <span style=\"background-color:#e53935;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">admired</span> </span>him because his passion, you <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">rarely</span> </span>see someone who is looking and trying to improve each and every day, not just in sports,&nbsp; but as a parent, as a husband. I am <span style=\"background-color:#e53935;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">inspired</span> </span>by <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">what he's done</span></span><span style=\"background-color:#689f38;\">,</span> and what he's shared with Vanessa, and what he's shared with his kids.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>I have a daughter who's 30 and I became a grandparent. And I have two twins.&nbsp; I have twins at 6. I can't wait to get home to become a GirlDad and to hug them and to see the love and smiles that they bring to us as parents.&nbsp; He taught me that just by looking at this tonight, looking at how he responded and reacted with the people he actually loved.&nbsp; These are the things that we will continue to learn from Kobe Bryant.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>To Vanessa, Natalia, Bianka, Capri, my wife and <span style=\"background-color:#9ccc65;color:#616161;\">I will keep you</span> <span style=\"background-color:#e53935;\">close </span><span style=\"background-color:#9ccc65;\">in our hearts and our <span class=\"blue bold\">prayers</span></span>. We will always be here for you.&nbsp; Always. I also want to <span style=\"background-color:#d32f2f;color:#fafafa;\">offer </span>our <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">condolences</span> </span>and support to all the families affected by this <span style=\"background-color:#e53935;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">enormous</span> <span class=\"blue bold\">tragedy</span></span><span style=\"color:#fafafa;\">.</span></p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>Kobe gave every last <span class=\"blue bold\">ounce</span> of himself to whatever he was doing, After basketball, he showed a creative side to himself that I didn't think any of us knew he had.&nbsp; In <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">retirement</span></span>, he seemed so happy. He found new passions. And he continued to give back, as a coach, in his community.&nbsp; More importantly, he was an amazing dad, amazing husband, who <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><span class=\"blue bold\">dedicated</span> himself to</span> his family and who loved his daughters with all his heart.&nbsp; Kobe never left anything on the court. And I think that's what he would want for us to do.</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>No one knows how much time we have. That's why we must<span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><i> <span class=\"blue bold\">live in</span> the momen</i></span><span style=\"background-color:#689f38;\"><i>t</i></span>,&nbsp; we must <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><i><span class=\"blue bold\">enjoy the moment</span></i></span>, we must reach and see and spend as much time as we can with our families and friends and the people that we absolutely love.&nbsp; <span style=\"background-color:#689f38;color:#fafafa;\"><i><span class=\"blue bold\"><strong>To live in the moment</strong></span></i></span> means to enjoy each and every one that we come in contact with.&nbsp;</p><p>    <p>&nbsp;</p><p>    <p><i><u>When </u><span class=\"blue bold\"><u>Kobe Bryant died</u></span></i>, a piece of me died.
